# Specialize, they say

I’ve been reading a lot about how to make your way in this crazy world of people who make web sites.  Several authorities have suggested that, especially when starting out, it’s a good idea to specialize in one particular niche.

I’ve decided to concentrate on WordPress development for several reasons:

*   WordPress is one of the most popular blogging and CMS systems out there today.
*   In the hands of an expert, WP can be extremely flexible.
*   WP is easy to get started with, but difficult to master.  Inexperienced users often require expert assistance in customization.
*   I’m already using it for this site, and have at least one more site in development using it.
*   The skills used in creating wordpress themes (XHTML, CSS, PHP) are all applicable to generic web design uses – I’m not boxing myself in.

The plan for now is to keep practicing with custom wordpress themes.  First up is a redesign of this site.  Yep, it’s only a couple of weeks old and it’s already on the chopping block.  What can I say?  Sometimes I’m a perfectionist.
