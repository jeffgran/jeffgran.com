# Site Upgrades: WordPress 2.8

WordPress 2.8 [was released][1] on Wednesday, and I’ve upgraded my site.  I’m looking forward to playing with the new widgets API.  Hmm… what kind of widgets will I make?

I also upgraded to the latest [Pods][2] release (1.6.5), which will allow some nifty behind-the-scenes magic to happen.

That’s all.  Carry on.
