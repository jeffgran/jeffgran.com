# Just the Basic Facts

Hi, I'm Jeff.

* I love writing code. I put some of the stuff I write on [github][].
* I love open source software.
* I love [javascript][] and [ruby][], but that's just because those are what I have been exposed to the most.
* I also program to varying degrees in Python, Java, Scala, Clojure, Lisp (emacs flavored), Elixir.
* I have strong opinions about how I want to interact with my computer (keyboard only, when possible), so I use highly customized [emacs][] and [conkeror][] for most everything I do.
* I also make art of various media: music, drawings, design, etc.
* I currently work at a company called [TRELORA][].
* I live in Denver, CO, USA.
* Sometimes I feel like writing about a thought I had or something I learned. [So I put it here](/archive.html).
