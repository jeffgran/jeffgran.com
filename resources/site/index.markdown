## Just the Facts

I'm Jeff.

* I love writing code.
* I used to love javascript. Now I love ruby. I think my next new love is about to be lisp/clojure.
* I have a passion for elegant, efficient user interfaces.
* I love customizing my personal user interface to my computer, so I basically use emacs and conkeror for everything I do.
* I live in Denver, CO, USA.
* Sometimes I feel like writing about a thought I had or something I learned. [So I put it here](/archive.html).
