# Just the Basic Facts

I'm Jeff.

* I love writing code. I put some of the stuff I write on [github][].
* I love open source software.
* I used to love [javascript][]. Now I love [ruby][]. I think my next new love is about to be lisp/clojure.
* I have a passion for elegant, efficient user interfaces.
* I love customizing my personal user interface to my computer, so I basically use [emacs][] and [conkeror][] for everything I do.
* I also make art of various media: music, drawings, design, etc.
* I currently work at a company called [OpenLogic][].
* I live in Denver, CO, USA.
* Sometimes I feel like writing about a thought I had or something I learned. [So I put it here](/archive.html).
