# Site Theme Upgrade

I’ve “gone live” with the theme upgrade I’ve been working on.  This represents a week’s worth of work or so.  I added many new features, including a custom front page, a widgetized sidebar, and a custom sidebar widget displaying my social media, email and rss links (with custom-created buttons, of course).

The portfolio section is empty as of now, as I am in development of a new structure for it using the [Pods CMS plugin][1] for WordPress.
