# My New Garage

I like building things. For work I build virtual things, but recently I decided to build some stuff in my garage. I wish I had "before" pictures, but I don't. But, here are the "after" pictures.

I painted the walls (with help from my girlfriend Annie G), built the shelves and the work bench, mounted the peg-board and hung all the tools and skis and stuff on the wall.

The plan was to have a lot of storage space, and my work space out there, but with no clutter on the floor, and with plenty of room to walk around the cars and open the doors. Thus the high shelves all the way around.
