** Dear Google: "memory leak" is not a synonym for "memory spike"
** I try not to say "Mexicans" because I don't know if they're from Mexico or not... we need a new word called "SOUS" or sous, that means South Of United States. because "mexican or central american or south american" is just too many damn sillables
