# Just the Basic Facts

I'm Jeff.

* I love writing code. I put some of the stuff I write on [github][].
* I love open source software.
* I like [ruby][] and [javascript][], but that's just because those are what I have used the most. When I'm in Ruby and JS I crave a better type system. What the hell kind of data is in this variable? Who knows!
* I also program/have programmed to varying degrees in Swift, Java, Scala, Clojure, Lisp (emacs flavored), Elixir, Rust, C++.
* I have strong opinions about how I want to interact with my computer (keyboard only, when possible), so I use highly customized [emacs][] and ~~[conkeror][]~~ (conkeror is dead :( and I haven't been able to find a good way to emulate that with a normal browser.).
* I'm primarily a web developer. but I want to transition into cyber-security work, specifically [applied cryptography](/2018/04/08/applied-cryptography/).
* I also like to make art of various media: music, drawings, design, etc.
* I currently work at a company called [Le Tote][].
* I live in Colorado Springs, CO, USA. I work remotely.
* Sometimes I feel like writing about a thought I had or something I learned. [So I put it here](/posts_by_date).
