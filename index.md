# Just the Basic Facts

I'm Jeff.

* I love writing code. Check out some of the stuff I've written on my [projects page][].
* I love open source software.
* I'm primarily a web developer historically. I have been transitioning to focus on security related work.
* I like Ruby and JavaScript, but that's just because those are what I have used the most.
* I also program/have programmed to varying degrees in Golang, Python, Java, Scala, Clojure, Lisp (emacs flavored), Elixir, Rust, C++.
* I have strong opinions about how I want to interact with my computer (keyboard only, when possible), so I use highly customized [emacs][] and ~~[conkeror][]~~ (conkeror is dead :( and I haven't been able to find a good way to emulate that with a normal browser.).
* I also like to make art of various media: music, drawings, design, etc.
* I currently work at a company called [Doximity][].
* I live in Colorado, USA. I work remotely.
* Sometimes I feel like writing about a thought I had or something I learned. [So I put it here](/blog.html).

And that's about all I have to say about that.
